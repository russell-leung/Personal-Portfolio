					<h2>Hangman</h2>
					<p>Hangman is a game where a player attempts to guess the letters of a word. However, everytime they guess incorrectly
						a part of the drawing is done. The player loses when the drawing of the hangman is complete. Using Python, I recreated
						a text-based Hangman game with more than 800 possible words.</p>

          <h2>War Simulation</h2>
          <p>War is a game in which two players utalize a deck of 52 cards, the deck is randomly suffled and put into two seperate decks of 26, one for each user. With the highet card being the ace and the lowest card being the 2,the uses simotaniously flip the first card in their decks and the player with the highest value card takes both player's cards. If the users both flip a card of the same value then a "war" will start. Both users will place 3 cards face dow and flip their 4th card, the player with the highest value card will take all the cards. If the users again place down the same value card, another war will start. The game continues until one player has 0 cards left in their deck.</p>
